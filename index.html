      HIT: The Third Case[a] is a 2025 Indian Telugu-language neo - noir action
      thriller film[4] written and directed by Sailesh Kolanu. Produced by Wall
      Poster Cinema and Unanimous Productions, it is the third installment in
      the HIT film series following HIT: The Second Case (2022). The film stars
      Nani and Srinidhi Shetty (in her Telugu film debut). In the film, a
      ruthless police officer is sent by the Homicide Intervention Team (HIT) to
      find a group of killers and put an end to their grisly murder spree. The
      Third Case was first teased in the credits of its predecessor, with Nani
      leading the cast. In February 2024, Nani's commitments went to Nani 32,
      directed by Sujeeth and produced by DVV Entertainment. However, due to
      delays with the director's They Call Him OG (2025) led to postponement
      with the start of its production. By September, Nani began prioritising
      The Third Case. Principal photography took place from September 2024 to
      March 2025 in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam and Jammu and Kashmir. The film has
      music composed by Mickey J. Meyer, cinematography handled by Sanu Varghese
      and editing by Karthika Srinivas.

      Vijay Deverakonda’s latest outing, Kingdom, seems to be hitting the right
      notes with audiences and at the box office. Released on July 31, the spy
      action thriller has opened with an impressive Rs 15.50 crore on its first
      day, according to early estimates by trade tracker Sacnilk. While it falls
      slightly short of Liger's Rs 16 crore Day 1 collection, it comfortably
      surpasses Kushi (Rs 15.25 crore), making it one of the strongest openers
      in Vijay’s career. Coming off the back of a few underwhelming
      performances, this solid start signals a much-needed boost for the actor
      and a positive trajectory for the film.
